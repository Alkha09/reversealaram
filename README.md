# ReverseAlaram üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Reverse Alarm Clock is a mischievous and unconventional alarm system designed to disrupt sleep at unpredictable intervals. It rings loudly every few minutes, presenting random riddles that change every 10 seconds and must be solved to stop the sound. Only after successfully answering and undergoing a fake webcam scan does the alarm finally turn off‚Äîuntil the next random wake-up

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Reverse Alarm Clock fixes the world's nonexistent need for chaos in sleep by ringing randomly and demanding riddles

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an alarm that rings every few minutes just to annoy you, plays loud looping sounds, throws random riddles at you, and won‚Äôt stop until you pass a totally fake webcam scan.
It‚Äôs the perfect way to ruin a perfectly good nap‚Äîfor no good reason

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frameworks used-None
- Libraries used-Web Speech API (for speech synthesis),HTML5 Audio(for alarm sound)
- Tools used-VS Code (development),Browser (Chrome/Firefox for testing),Online audio source for alarm (or local MP3 for offline use)

For Hardware:
- List main components-Nil
- List specifications-Nil
- List tools required-Nil

### Implementation
For Software:
A user sets their desired sleep and wake time via time inputs.
The app calculates the interval and randomly schedules alarm(s) every 2 minutes (or as configured).
When the alarm triggers:
    A looping alarm sound plays loudly.
    A riddle is displayed that changes every 10 seconds until answered correctly.
    Once solved, the app initiates a fake webcam scan animation.
    Only after the "scan" ends does the alarm stop, allowing the user to go back to sleep

# Diagrams
1.User Sets Sleep & Wake Time
 The user selects their bedtime and wake-up time using two <input type="time"> fields.
2.Alarm Scheduling
 Based on the time difference, the app randomly schedules alarms every 2 minutes (or another interval) between sleep and wake time.
3.Alarm Triggers
  At each alarm time:
    A loud looping bell sound plays.
    A riddle is shown to the user.
    The riddle changes every 10 seconds until solved.
4.User Solves Riddle
 The user must type the correct answer. Wrong answers trigger funny roast responses and increase the alarm volume.
5.Webcam Scan (Fake)
  Upon solving the riddle, the app pretends to perform a face scan using the webcam.
6.Alarm Stops
  After the fake scan completes, the alarm sound stops.
  The next random alarm will repeat the chaos, ensuring no peaceful sleep.
